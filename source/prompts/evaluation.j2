You are evaluating factual correctness between a reference text and a response text.

REFERENCE TEXT:
{{REF_TEXT}}

RESPONSE TEXT:
{{RES_TEXT}}

Please analyze the factual accuracy and return ONLY a JSON object with these exact keys:
- "f1": F1 score (0.0 to 1.0)
- "precision": Precision score (0.0 to 1.0) 
- "recall": Recall score (0.0 to 1.0)

Calculate these metrics based on:
- Precision: What fraction of claims in the response are factually correct according to the reference
- Recall: What fraction of facts from the reference are captured in the response
- F1: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

Return only the JSON object, no other text.
