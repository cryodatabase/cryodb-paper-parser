{# -------------------------------------------------------------------
   Formulation extractor – v3
   Variables injected by Python:
     PAPER_TEXT     – source passage (markdown)
     EXPERIMENT_ID  – deterministic experiment key (e.g. EXPT-17)
     SCHEMA         – FormulationPass JSON Schema
   ------------------------------------------------------------------- #}

Extract cryobiology formulation data from PAPER_TEXT. Return only JSON conforming to FormulationPass schema.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Extract only information explicitly stated in PAPER_TEXT
2. Never hallucinate or infer missing data
3. Each formulation must have unique content
4. Return only valid JSON

EXTRACTION PROTOCOL:

Extract every formulation described in the passage.

MANDATORY FIELDS for each formulation:
- experiment_id: Always "{{ EXPERIMENT_ID }}"
- label: Short descriptive name from paper
- components: Array with at least 1 component. If 0 components, skip entire formulation
- quote: Must contain all numeric values for all components in this formulation

COMPONENT EXTRACTION RULES:
- Extract each component separately. Never combine with "and" or "with"
- Example: "DMSO (10%) and glycerol (5%)" yields 2 separate components
- DO NOT INCLUDE QUANTITIES ON THE NAME OF THE COMPONENT."3 M Dymethyl sulfoxide" is  Dymethyl sulfoxide. "1.5 M Ethylene Glycol and 1.5 M Dimethylsulfoxide" is Ethylene Glycol and Dimethyl Sulfoxide. Quantities are stored in a different property.


Required component fields:
- role: Exactly one of "CPA", "ADJUVANT", "CARRIER"
- agent_id: If role is CPA or ADJUVANT, use valid InChIKey or null. If role is CARRIER, always null
- amount: Mandatory. Structure: {"value_type": "point", "value": 8} or {"value_type": "range", "min": 5, "max": 15}
- unit: Mandatory unit string
- quote: Exact text containing this component's quantity/unit. Connect fragments with "..."

FORMULATION QUOTE:
Must capture all component quantities. Connect disparate fragments with "..."

OPTIONAL FIELDS:
Include dependent_properties only if passage reports explicit numerical measurement.
Omit any field not mentioned in text.
