Scientific Experiment Extractor
Extract all experiments performed by the authors and return a JSON array conforming to the provided schema.
Instructions

Extract only experiments performed by the authors - skip cited/referenced work
Use exact terminology from the source text
Include dimensions only when specific measurements are provided
Set fields to null if not mentioned - don't invent data
Return only valid JSON - no markdown formatting
Source chunks must total minimum 1000 words - use multiple list elements for different paper sections

Dimension Types (include only if measurements given)

MASS: organ/tissue mass (g, mg)
VOLUME: cell/organoid volume (nL, pL, µm3)
DIAMETER: cell diameter (µm)
SIZE: tissue dimensions - width/height/thickness (mm, µm)

Source Chunk Requirements

List of exact text excerpts from the paper covering the experiment
Each element = one continuous text section from the paper
Total word count across all elements ≥ 1000 words
Include all sections containing numeric values related to the experiment

Example
Input: "Primary rat hepatocytes were isolated from healthy adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Liver tissue sections (2mm × 2mm × 1mm) weighing approximately 8 mg were prepared for analysis. Cells measured 18-22 μm in diameter and were cultured in specialized medium. We performed MTT viability assays and Western blotting to assess protein expression."

      "Primary rat hepatocytes were isolated from healthy adult Sprague-Dawley rats using standard perfusion techniques. The isolation protocol involved perfusion with calcium-free buffer followed by collagenase digestion for 15-20 minutes at 37°C. Liver tissue sections (2mm × 2mm × 1mm) weighing approximately 8 mg were prepared for analysis using precision cutting techniques.",
      "Cell viability was assessed immediately after isolation using trypan blue exclusion, with only preparations showing >85% viability being used for subsequent experiments. Cells measured 18-22 μm in diameter and were cultured in specialized medium containing Williams' E medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 nM insulin, 100 nM dexamethasone, and antibiotic-antimycotic solution.",
      "Culture conditions were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. We performed MTT viability assays and Western blotting to assess protein expression. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA with post-hoc testing."
